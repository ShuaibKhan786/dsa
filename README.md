## DESCRIPTION
Just a repo me practising DSA problems
I used neetcode [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)

## PROBLEMS (Arrays and Hashing)

1. duplicate in array (set) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem1.go)
2. is Anagram (hmap, store character count) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem2.go)
3. two sums (hmap, key = ele, value = index, x + y = target i,e x = target - y) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem3.go)
4. k most frequent element (hmap , key = num, value = frequency, sorted bucket algo) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem4.go)
5. String Encode and Decode (attached length of string before actual string) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem5.go)
6. Products of Array Discluding Self (maintained product of left and right of an element) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem6.go)
7. longest consecutive sequence (set , if num - 1 is not in the set then num is the new sequence) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem7.go)

## PROBLEMS (Two Pointers)

8. is palindrome (compare two pointer one from start and one from end, skip if the byte/character is not alphanumeric) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem8.go)
9. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (array is sorted is ASC, left and right pointers) [mySolution](https://github.com/ShuaibKhan786/dsa/blob/main/problems/problem9.go)
